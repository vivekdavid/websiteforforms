# Wesbsite for court forms 

This is the code for a simple node.js website that provides court forms and instructions based on the type of case you have.  

It features stripe integration for external checkout and uses the nunjucks views engin.  

The code is complete but I'm still working on writing up the insructions - thus there are no files in the views folder other than the index.js which is required for the stripe integration.
